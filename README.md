React, PapaParse, file-saver, and Chart.js are among the essential packages and libraries that are imported by this programme.

It describes a useful React component called App that will actually render the application.

The useState hook is used by the component to define the states data, csvData, and canvasRef. The chart data will be kept in the data state as an object with labels and dataset characteristics. The data that will be exported in CSV format will be stored in the csvData state. The HTML canvas element where the chart will be displayed will be referenced using the canvasRef state, which is established using the useRef hook.

The component includes a function called fetchData that will use the fetch API to retrieve the text file from the URL. The function divides the text into words, counts each word's frequency, sorts the words by frequency in decreasing order, chooses the top 20 most common words, and stores the data as an array of objects with the properties word and count. The function then stores the data in the data state after converting it to a format that is suitable for charts. The function also changes the data's format to CSV and puts it in the csvData state.

The component defines a function called handleExport that is triggered when the user clicks the export button. This function uses the PapaParse library to convert the csvData to his CSV format and uses the saveAs function from the file saver library to save the file.

The component defines a useEffect hook that fires when the data changes state. The hook initializes a new Chart.js chart object and renders it to the HTML canvas element referenced by CanvasRef.
 
The component renders a button with a click event listener that triggers the fetchData function when clicked. If the data state is not null, the component renders a canvas element and a button with a Click event listener that triggers the handleExport function when clicked.
